# OpenHab-with-Control4
work-in-progress files for an openhab install that directly communicates with some Control4 components.

As of 8/2/2017, this includes a basic sitemap for some items related to the standard Control4 radio tuner and amp. It can directly turn on the radio, change stations, and change the volume. This does not require anything to be installed on the Control4 Hub, and should work whether or not a Control4 hub is present.

This is a companion project to my site smartishhome.com, which offers <a href="https://www.smartishhome.com">smart home component reviews and guides</a>.
